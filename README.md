A coffee shop company operates across three locations and receives high volumes of daily sales. However, they lack the expertise to analyze this data effectively, making it difficult for them to gain insights into their business performance. They need a data analyst to process and evaluate their sales data to identify trends, optimize product offerings, and pinpoint peak sales times for each location which will help them make data-driven decisions to maximize revenue and improve overall efficiency.

They need insights on;
1. Top 5 perfoming products across all stores
2. Peak Sales times during the day
3. Months with the highest Sales
4. Top selling product categories
