The main objective of this project is to analyse retail sales data to 
gain actionable insights that will enhance the performance of the Coffee Shop.
The dashboard displays daily, weekly, and monthly sales data, helping you
identify trends, peak hours, and best-selling items. This allows the shop to adjust its
inventory and staffing accordingly. It also summarizes sales by location giving you a
quick view of the financial health of your shop.
